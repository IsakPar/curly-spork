---

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start (30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Review the Audit (5 min)
```bash
# Read the comprehensive audit (embedded in PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md)
cat PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md | head -300
```

**Key findings:**
- Strong foundation with excellent crypto
- 2 services production-ready, 4 to build
- CI needs immediate fix
- 24-week path to S-tier

### Step 2: Fix CI (10 min)
```bash
# Read the CI fix guide
cat CI_FIX_GUIDE.md

# Apply the fixes to .github/workflows/ci.yml:
# 1. Remove duplicate pnpm setup (lines 64-72)
# 2. Increase health check intervals (5s → 10s)
# 3. Enhance wait scripts with DNS checks
# 4. Add debugging output
```

**Manual steps required:**
1. Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the fixes
2. Commit changes
3. Push and verify CI passes
4. Confirm 3 consecutive green runs

### Step 3: Migrate Repository (10 min)
```bash
# Ensure CI is green first!

# Run the automated migration script
./MIGRATION_SCRIPT.sh

# The script will:
# ✅ Create backups
# ✅ Tag current state (v0.1.0-pre-migration)
# ✅ Clone new repo (sturdy-guacamole)
# ✅ Merge code
# ✅ Update references
# ✅ Push to GitHub
# ✅ Create v0.1.0 release tag
```

**New repository:** https://github.com/Nyx-Loma/sturdy-guacamole

### Step 4: Set Up Branch Protection (5 min)
Go to: https://github.com/Nyx-Loma/sturdy-guacamole/settings/branches

**Main branch:**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass (CI)
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Do not allow force pushes

**Staging branch:**
- ✅ Require status checks to pass (CI)
- ✅ Allow force pushes (for rebasing)

### Step 5: Verify & Celebrate! (5 min)
```bash
# Clone the new repo
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/Nyx-Loma/sturdy-guacamole.git
cd sturdy-guacamole

# Verify all files present
ls -la

# Check CI status
# Go to: https://github.com/Nyx-Loma/sturdy-guacamole/actions

# If green: 🎉 YOU'RE READY FOR PHASE 1!
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### During CI Fix:
- **Test locally first** with docker-compose to simulate CI
- **Add verbose logging** to diagnose connection issues
- **Increase timeouts** for service health checks
- **Compare environments** (local vs CI) carefully

### During Migration:
- **Run the script** instead of manual steps (less error-prone)
- **Keep backups** for at least 30 days
- **Don't delete old repo** immediately (archive after 30 days)
- **Verify CI in new repo** before announcing to team

### During Phase 1-4:
- **One service at a time** — don't parallelize too much
- **Test in staging first** — always
- **Document as you go** — don't defer docs
- **Feature flags everything** — default OFF
- **Monitor closely** — watch metrics during rollouts

- ❌ CI still failing after 3 attempts to fix
- ❌ Test coverage drops below 85%
- ❌ Critical security vulnerability discovered
- ❌ Performance targets missed by >50%
- ❌ Team unavailable (vacation, illness)
- ❌ Budget/timeline constraints change

**Green flags to proceed:**
- ✅ CI passing consistently (3+ runs)
- ✅ All tests green
- ✅ Coverage thresholds met
- ✅ Team aligned on roadmap
- ✅ Resources available
